  You may provide your own secret, or one will be generated for you. Once your
  application credential is created, the secret will be revealed once. If you
  lose the secret, you will have to generate a new application credential.

  You may give the application credential an expiration. The expiration will
  be in UTC. If you provide an expiration date with no expiration time, the
  time will be assumed to be 00:00:00. If you provide an expiration time with
  no expiration date, the date will be assumed to be today.

  {% blocktrans trimmed %}
  You may select one or more roles for this application credential. If you do
  not select any, all of the roles you have assigned on the current project
  will be applied to the application credential.

  By default, for security reasons, application credentials are forbidden from
  being used for creating additional application credentials or keystone
  trusts. If your application credential needs to be able to perform these
  actions, check "unrestricted".
